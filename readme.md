Controller for COMPUTHERM Q7RF (RX) receivers.
Based on https://github.com/nistvan86/esphome-q7rf and the examples in https://github.com/LSatan/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib

Changes:
- Support for message format used by the newer generation of devices. (The message seems to be compatible with the old messages, but I didn't verify it.)
- Support for multiple devices
